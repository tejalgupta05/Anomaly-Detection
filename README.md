# Anomaly-Detection
Most of the methods either relies on traditional methods of motion detection, some modern systems based on machine learning are using deep learning models for object or person detection for surveillance. Fewer researchers have explored some other techniques such as anomaly detection which has been applied for big scale modelling of surveillance systems. In our project we will be focusing on small scale surveillance system based on deep learning and anomaly detection.
# Proposed methodology:
This methodology is primarily based on detecting changes in color patterns of the images by looking at the changes in pixel values of the images. Further these changes can be applied to find anomalies in the color pattern which will tell us about the change or movement in the room.
